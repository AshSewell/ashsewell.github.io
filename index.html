			<p>Hi my name's Ash Sewell. I'm a C++/UE4 developer from Australia and I've been programming and making games since 2017. I enjoy writing game systems, shaders, tools and delving into engine code. I also enjoy playing games, like League of Legends, Magic the Gathering and Minecraft.</p>
			<div class = "spacer"></div>
			<h2>Skills</h2>
			<p>My main skills are C++, Unreal Engine 4 and GLSL. Additionally I have experience with C#, HLSL, and I created this website from scratch using HTLM, CSS, and little bit of JavaScript.</p>
