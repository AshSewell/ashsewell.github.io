            <h3> GunPUNK </h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PFz2xX7E0FY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen alt = "GunPUNK video"></iframe>
            <p> GunPUNK is a turn-based strategic shooter where your goal as the player is to bounce lasers off the environment to kill enemies. This project was developed using UE4 in about 15 weeks by four other students and I for our major project at AIE. I developed the core game systems in C++, and the AI using behaviour trees. I also created some materials/shaders using the material editor and HLSL.  </p>

            <h3> Medieval Ninja Saloon </h3>

            <p>Medieval Ninja Saloon was created for a two day game jam with other students at AIE. We were given the random theme of "medieval ninja saloon", and this is what we came up with. This game was developed in UE4, and I created all of the games systems using blueprints.</p>

            <h3> Dawn VR </h3>
            <img src = "/images/dawn.png" alt = "Dawn screenshot"></img>
            <p>Dawn is a VR horror game that was developed for the Occulus Go. Your aim is to defend yourself against ghosts until morning, while conserving your torch's battery. Dawn was developed using UE4 in about 3 weeks for a group assessment for AIE. I programmed the core game systems in C++ and using blueprints for game mechanics. </p>
